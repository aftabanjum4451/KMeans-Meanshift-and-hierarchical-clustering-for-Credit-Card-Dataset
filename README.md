# KMeans, Meanshift and hierarchical clustering for Credit Card Dataset
Unsupervised learning is the focus of this personal project, which is separated into three sections: In the first part, I performed exploratory data analysis, in the second part, three clustering techniques, and in the third part, model evaluation to check the performance of the developed model. Finally, a scatter plot was utilised to visualise the clusters that had been created.

## Project Highlight
- Load the data  
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
  - Data distribution (BOX plot, scatter plot, pair plot)
  - Features correlation
  - Outlier Detection
  - Removed the Outlier using IQR, Z-score
  - KNN imputer (Handle missing values)
- Data Normalization
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA
- Elbow Method 
- **Models**
  - KMeans
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - Mean shift clustering
- **Model Evaluation**
  - Silhouette SCore
  - Davies-Bouldin score
- Clusters Analysis and visualization
